Here you can take a look on how code blocks, lists, tables and a few headers look like.

### Header 3

```python
# Python code with syntax highlighting
def say_hello(name):
    """Print hello message"""
    print(f'Hello {name}')

```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

#### Header 4

{:.nes-list .is-disc}
*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

This is how a table should look like.

{:.nes-table .is-bordered}
| head1        | head two          | three |
